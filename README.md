Project name: Jogo do Numero Secreto (Secret Number Game)

This project is the result of the studies in Logic in programming.

The main objective is to make a game where the player has to guess a number in an specific range (in this case, from 1 to 10).
We used conditionals to perform checks in the guesses of the player and return a response in case it's a right or wrong guess.
In case it was a wrong guess we would inform if the secret number is bigger or lesser than the player's guess.
We added a funcionality of voicing what is written on the screen for accessibility.
The secret number is a random number and at each new play we would get a different number from the ones that have already been shown.
This means that we stored the sorted numbers in a list in order to keep track of the sorted numbers and only choose new ones.
